### Hello, folks 👋

My name is Ambreen Khan & I am a software testing professional. My nearly 15 years of experience in Information Technology is definitely varied, ranging from Web Site Development(www.rmhsolutions.com) & App Designing to Testing & Automation. Passion for quality is what drives me and I like to follow best practices whenever possible.

As someone who has done both, software development & testing, I would say I have an equal appreciation for both. I like to be able to create software that can “drive” other software as part of a test. This allows me to keep both my Tester & Developer mindset’s working and thinking.

### ✍️ Blog & Writing
Apart from testing, I also love to share my knowledge. You can find my articles on my blog [Software Testing Trends](https://softwaretestingtrends.com/), on my [Tech Journal](https://ambreenkhan.dev/) & on my Github Wiki [Tech Journal](https://arkhangelsk.github.io/TechJournal/)
